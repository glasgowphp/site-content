### Why should we encourage student OSS participation?

We tend to remember our computing education to be very technical and limited in 
interaction with other peers (unless it was that dreaded group project!). 
But lets imagine how this could be improved to help future students get a 
better sense of what it’s like in a realistic development environment – 
without scaring them off!

In this talk we are going to explore how teaching students about participating 
in open source software projects can help build up their technical & social 
skills to venture out into the professional world. We discuss how merely 
engaging with others in online communities can have a positive impact on their 
interest in computing and potentially the project itself. We also talk about 
some of these projects they can explore (including PHP), the materials 
available to help teach faculty how to incorporate this into their curriculum, 
and how you can get involved in encouraging the younger generation to 
participate and learn from the open source projects we may often use daily.
