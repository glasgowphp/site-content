### Refactoring with Rector

As big codebases age they often struggle to keep up with changes to programming languages and package development.
New language features can't be easily adopted, and packages are often stuck on an old version due to a 
backwards-incompatible change. Fixing this requires large scale refactoring which can often take hundreds of hours. 
Why not automate it?  
<br/>
In this talk we'll look at Rector, a PHP refactoring tool that automates hundreds of different refactorings. 
We'll look at different use cases, writing our own refactorings, and even converting an entire project 
from one framework to another!
