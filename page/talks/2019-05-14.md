### Acceptance testing with Robot Framework

Join us for a talk about acceptance testing using Robot Framework.
Mike will briefly talk about the reasons why a generic framework might be preferable,
go over the setup and day to day usage with examples.  
This talk will cover topics that should help you start using Robot Framework in your own project, 
such as setup, syntax, available libraries, advice on how to write good tests and a few pointers on
issues that you might encounter.

Big thanks to this months sponsors **Inviqa** and **JetBrains**.
